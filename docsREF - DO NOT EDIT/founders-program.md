# Founders Program (Early Access)

Building in public means you're invited to shape what gets built.

---

## What you get

**Early access to Template Pack v1** (before public launch)
- March 2026: You get it. Public: April 2026.
- Feedback shapes what goes in the pack (you're part of the process)
- Lifetime updates included

**Lifetime pricing ($69 instead of $99)**
- A thank you for taking the risk on an unfinished product
- One-time purchase, forever access

**Direct email from me**
- Not a mailing list, direct feedback loop
- You shape the next template pack (v1.1, v2, etc.)
- Your use cases matter

---

## What "early access" means

**You're getting:**
- Tested hardware + firmware
- Measurement methodology that works
- Implementation files you can build from

**You're not getting:**
- Perfection (expect to find bugs, report them, get fixes)
- Handholding (you're a builder, not a customer support ticket)
- Guarantees (this is still an active project)

**You are getting:**
- Real files from someone who's building for real
- Measured data you can trust
- A voice in what gets built next

## Timeline

**February 2026:** Founders program opens
- First 20–50 people get early access + $69 lifetime price
- Feedback period (you tell me what works and what breaks)

**Early March 2026:** Founders access + feedback loop
- You're building with the pack, reporting issues
- Improvements ship as updates (free to you)

**Late March 2026:** Template Pack v1 locked
- Final version released to founders
- Public launch at $99

**April 2026+:** Public launch
- Founders still have lifetime price + updates
- New customers pay $99

## Who this is for

**Early builders:**
You want to ship fast and don't mind helping debug the process. You get real value (Altium + firmware + validation), and you help make it better.

**Portfolio builders:**
You want to show real work (measured, tested, shipped). Early access = you're part of something real.

**Hardware engineers:**
You want patterns and processes you can adapt. You're building anyway; help validate the approach.

## How to join

**Email:** `kyle@nodifyr.io`

Subject: "Interested in Founders Program"

Include:
- What you're building (or planning to build)
- Why you're interested in this specific approach
- How you'd use the template pack

That's it. Not a lengthy form, just context.

First come, first served (limiting to 20–50 people).

## FAQ

**What if I find a bug?**
Report it. If it's real, it gets fixed. Updates ship free to all founders.

**What if I want a refund?**
You've got 30 days. After that, you're committed. But if the hardware/firmware is genuinely broken (not just "I don't like it"), we'll sort it out.

**Can I share the files with my team?**
Your team can use it. One license per organization, though. If you're a bigger team, email me and we'll figure it out.

**What about support?**
Email support for the first month after purchase. After that, community support (GitHub issues, Discord, etc. — we'll set it up).

**When does the public price lock in?**
$99 is permanent. Founders get $69 forever. If you buy later, it's $99. No price increases (probably).

## The real ask

You're investing $69 in something unfinished because you believe in the approach.

In exchange, you get:
- Measured design work (4–6 months of engineering)
- Tested implementation (hardware + firmware that works)
- Lifetime updates (your files get better over time)
- A voice in what's next

No BS. No "exclusive Discord." No "special status." Just real access and real product.
