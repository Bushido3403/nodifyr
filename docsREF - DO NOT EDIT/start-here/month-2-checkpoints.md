# Month 2 Checkpoints: On Track

By end of February 2026, "on track" looks like this.

Not perfect. Just observable progress that replaces uncertainty with evidence.

---

## Narrative coherence

**Checkbox:** Every page tells the same story
- Home page → What is Nodifyr → Why this flagship → Locked contract → How to get it
- No contradictions, no confusing options, no "or maybe this"
- Someone new can follow the spine without getting lost

**Status:** ✓ Done (rebuild completed Jan 2026)

---

## First baseline measurements

**Checkbox:** Real measured numbers published
- Sleep current (even if it's worse than target, it's real)
- Wake energy (time × current profile)
- Charge balance (solar input vs. average consumption)
- One measured proof point per week (even if rough)

**Status:** ⏳ In progress
- Target: At least 3 baseline sets by Feb 28
- Publish methodology + equipment + results (not perfect, just real)

---

## Locked contract pieces

**Checkbox:** Packet format + measurement methodology are stable
- [Packet spec](../projects/solar-beacon-v1/packet-spec.md) v1 is documented
- [Measurement plan](../projects/solar-beacon-v1/measurement-plan.md) includes equipment, procedure, data format
- Both can be referenced without changing (everything else evolves)

**Status:** ✓ Done (locked Jan 18, 2026)

---

## Waitlist collecting emails

**Checkbox:** Actual people opting in
- [Waitlist link](https://nodifyr.io/waitlist) visible on home + Template Pack pages
- Target: 50+ emails by Feb 28 (don't obsess, just collect)
- Founders program actively recruiting (20–50 early builders)

**Status:** ⏳ In progress
- Email signup live
- Founders program email: `kyle@nodifyr.io`

---

## Clear Template Pack v1 outline

**Checkbox:** People can see exactly what they'll pay for
- [Template Pack page](../template-pack-v1.md) published with price ($99) + contents
- Clear launch date (March 2026)
- Founders alternative ($69, early access)

**Status:** ✓ Done (published Jan 18, 2026)

## Observable progress = legitimacy

Each of these checkpoints is a deliverable that *proves* you're building, not planning:

| Checkpoint | Shows | Proof |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Narrative coherence | Clear direction | Stranger reads 3 pages and understands |
| Baseline measurements | Real work | Numbers published (even if rough) |
| Locked contract | Seriousness | Spec won't change, so you mean it |
| Waitlist | Market interest | People opted in (real demand signal) |
| Clear Pack outline | Executable vision | You know what to build, customer knows what to buy |

Hitting all 5 by Feb 28 = "This person knows what they're doing."

---

## What success looks like by March 1

- 100+ people on waitlist
- 3 weeks of baseline measurements published
- $6,900+ potential revenue (100 early buyers × $69 Founders price)
- Reputation for "ships what he says" (every checkpoint hit on time)

That's not "startup," that's "portfolio + income pipeline."

---

## The psychological shift

**What kills projects:**
"I have a good idea, let me perfect the docs, then launch when everything is perfect"
→ 8 months later, still not shipped

**What works:**
"Every page is a deliverable, every measurement is content, every revision is legitimacy"
→ Ship consistently, build trust, collect money, keep going

Month 2 is about proving you're in the second camp.
