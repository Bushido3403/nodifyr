# Nodifyr Docs

---

## Welcome

This site contains the official documentation for **Nodifyr**, an ongoing open-source IoT ecosystem project developed by me, Kyle Buchanan.

I fully intend to develop Nodifyr as open-source as I can, and this documentation serves as a living record of its architecture, design decisions, hardware revisions, experiments, and lessons learned over time.

Keep in mind, this is not a finished product (yet), it's a transparent build process.

## Where should you start?

If you're new, start with **[What is Nodifyr?](https://docs.nodifyr.io/start-here/what-is-nodifyr/)**

That page explains my motivation behind the project, its long-term direction, and the kind of problems I aim to solve.

From there, you can explore:

- system architecture and interfaces
- board-specific documentation and revisions
- design decisions and tradeoffs
- measurements, testing notes, and known issues I discover
- devlogs on my ongoing progress

## About this site

I made this website using **Material for MkDocs** and it's built directly from Markdown files in my `nodifyr` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bushido3403/nodifyr).

My goal in documentation is durability and accuracy:

- documentation lives alongside the project itself
- changes are versioned
- assumptions and unknowns are tracked for future reference
- everything lives as context for future development

This page is intended to be a source of truth for the project, not a marketing page.

### P.S.

Where things are unfinished, uncertain, or untested, I will do my best to state that explicitly.
