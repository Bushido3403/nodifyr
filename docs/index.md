# Project Documentation

A technical platform built with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability.

This documentation serves as both a **design record** and a **living reference** for how the system is built, why decisions were made, and how components interact.

---

## What this project is

This project explores the design of a modular, production-oriented system intended to operate reliably in real-world conditions.

The focus is not on novelty, but on:
- clean interfaces
- explicit constraints
- measurable behavior
- and traceable decisions

---

## Current state

- Core architecture defined
- Initial hardware platform selected
- Power and system fundamentals validated
- Interfaces and expansion strategy in progress

This project is under active development, with each revision documented and versioned.

---

## Design philosophy

- **Systems first**  
  Architecture and interfaces are defined before implementation details.

- **Reproducibility over cleverness**  
  Every design choice should be explainable, repeatable, and testable.

- **Versioned evolution**  
  Changes are intentional and documented, not silent.

- **Real constraints**  
  Power, cost, manufacturability, and deployment are first-class concerns.

## How to navigate this documentation

If you are new:
- Start with the **System Overview**
- Read the **Roadmap** to understand direction and scope

If you are technical:
- Review the **Architecture** section
- Dive into **Interfaces** and **Board Revisions**
- See **Engineering Decisions (ADRs)** for rationale

If you are evaluating rigor:
- Look at **Testing**, **Measurements**, and **Known Issues**
- Read the **Devlog** entries for development context

## What this documentation is not

- It is not a marketing site
- It is not a tutorial-first guide
- It is not optimized for speed-reading

It is optimized for **understanding**.

## Status disclaimer

This documentation reflects the current state of the project and will evolve as the system matures.  
Older decisions are preserved for context, even when superseded.
